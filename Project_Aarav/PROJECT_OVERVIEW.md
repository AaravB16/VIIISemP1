# Project Aarav — Detailed Overview

**A Standardized Evaluation Framework for IoV Intrusion Detection**

---

## 1. Project Requirement

### 1.1 Problem Statement

The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) ecosystem relies on the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus for in-vehicle communication. CAN was designed without security mechanisms, leaving vehicles vulnerable to cyberattacks including denial-of-service (DoS), message spoofing, and replay attacks. Machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) are a promising countermeasure, but the research community lacks standardized evaluation frameworks, making it difficult to compare approaches and assess real-world readiness.

### 1.2 Objectives

1. **Build a reproducible evaluation framework** for benchmarking ML-based IDS on the CICIoV2024 dataset
2. **Evaluate multiple models** (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, LightGBM) across diverse split strategies
3. **Assess zero-day generalization** using attack-holdout evaluation where entire attack categories are withheld from training
4. **Measure deployment readiness** including inference latency, false positive rates, and robustness to data perturbations
5. **Introduce augmentation-based robustness evaluation** to validate model stability under realistic variations
6. **Produce comprehensive documentation** including results, analysis, and research-format reporting

### 1.3 Dataset

- **CICIoV2024** from the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity, University of New Brunswick
- CAN bus traffic in decimal format with 6 classes: BENIGN, DoS, Spoofing-GAS, Spoofing-RPM, Spoofing-SPEED, Spoofing-STEERING_WHEEL
- 1,408,219 raw frames → 3,588 unique frames after deduplication

### 1.4 Key Requirements

- Configurable via YAML (models, splits, augmentation, features)
- Deterministic execution (seed=42) for reproducibility
- Comprehensive metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC, detection rate, FPR, latency
- Automated report generation with visualizations
- Experiment metadata logging with dataset checksums and library versions
- Support for data augmentation and robustness analysis

### 2.2 Core Modules

#### Data Pipeline (`data_loader.py`, `preprocessing.py`)
- Loads 6 CSV files from CICIoV2024 (decimal format)
- Merges into unified DataFrame with label column
- Removes duplicates on `[ID, DATA_0...DATA_7]` (99.7% reduction)
- Applies Min-Max normalization
- Adds inter-arrival index feature

#### Split Strategies (`splitting.py`)
- **Random:** Stratified 80/20 train/test split
- **Scenario:** Splits by driving scenario/session groups
- **Attack Holdout:** For each of 5 attack types, excludes that type from training entirely. Tests model's ability to detect completely unseen attack categories (zero-day evaluation)

#### Model Training (`models.py`)
- Factory pattern with YAML-driven configuration
- **Random Forest:** 200 trees, max_depth=20, balanced class weights
- **SVM:** RBF kernel, C=1.0, gamma=scale, balanced weights, max_iter=5000
- **XGBoost:** 200 estimators, max_depth=8, LR=0.1, subsample=0.8
- **LightGBM:** 200 estimators, max_depth=8, 31 leaves, balanced weights

#### Evaluation (`evaluation.py`)
- Weighted-average precision, recall, F1-score
- ROC-AUC (one-vs-rest, where applicable)
- Detection Rate: recall specifically on attack classes
- False Positive Rate: rate of benign samples misclassified as attacks
- Training time and per-sample inference latency
- Label remapping helper for non-contiguous labels in holdout splits

#### Augmentation Engine (`augmentation_engine.py`)
Three augmentation strategies with deterministic seeded RNG:
1. **Timing Jitter (2%):** Gaussian perturbation of inter-arrival index
2. **Feature Noise (1%):** Additive Gaussian noise on CAN data bytes
3. **Attack Intensity Scaling (0.85×–1.15×):** Multiplicative scaling of attack frame features with automatic dtype upcasting to prevent int→float truncation

#### Robustness Analysis (`robustness.py`)
- Computes per-metric absolute deltas between original and augmented results
- Aggregates deltas into per-model robustness scores
- Ranks models by overall stability
- Outputs structured JSON with rankings and per-metric breakdowns

#### Visualization (`visualization.py`)
- Confusion matrices per model/split
- ROC curves (where applicable)
- Model comparison bar charts
- Training time comparisons
- Robustness heatmaps and performance drop charts

#### Reproducibility (`reproducibility.py`)
- Captures full experiment metadata: config, Python version, platform, library versions
- Computes SHA-256 checksums of all dataset files
- Logs augmentation parameters and dataset variant information
- Ensures bit-for-bit reproducible results with fixed seed

### 2.3 Experiment Runner (`run_experiment.py`)

The main script orchestrates the full pipeline:
1. Load and preprocess dataset
2. Generate augmented dataset variants (if enabled)
3. For each dataset variant × split strategy × model:
   - Split data, train model, evaluate, record results
4. Run robustness analysis comparing original vs. augmented results
5. Save all results, metadata, and reports to `results/`
6. Progress tracking via tqdm with logging integration

**Total experiments:** 4 models × 7 splits × 4 variants = 112

## 3. Results Summary

### 3.1 Baseline Performance

All four models achieve exceptional classification performance:

| Model | Best F1 | Best Split | Detection Rate | AUC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LightGBM | 0.9972 | Scenario | 1.000 | 0.9999 |
| XGBoost | 0.9970 | Random | 0.875 | 0.9999 |
| Random Forest | 0.9964 | Random | 0.875 | 0.9991 |
| SVM | 0.9951 | Scenario | 0.900 | 0.9999 |

### 3.2 Zero-Day Generalization

Attack holdout evaluation reveals critical gaps:

- **DoS Holdout:** Most challenging — XGBoost DR = 20%, RF DR = 28%. SVM uniquely maintains 100% DR.
- **RPM Holdout:** Second hardest — DR ranges from 43.75% (RF) to 62.5% (SVM)
- **GAS, SPEED, STEERING_WHEEL:** Better generalization — DR ranges from 70% to 100%

**Key Finding:** Tree-based models learn attack-specific patterns, while SVM learns generalized anomaly boundaries.

### 3.3 Robustness

Models are highly resilient to data perturbations:

| Model | Robustness Score | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| SVM | 0.000232 | Most stable — kernel smoothing resists perturbation |
| Random Forest | 0.000355 | Second most stable — ensemble averaging reduces variance |
| XGBoost | 0.000512 | Moderate — boosted trees show slight sensitivity |
| LightGBM | 0.000535 | Most sensitive — histogram binning affected by noise |

Maximum F1 delta across all 84 augmented experiments: **< 0.004**

### 3.4 Real-Time Viability

All models achieve sub-millisecond inference latency, well within CAN bus timing constraints (1–10 ms frame intervals):
- Fastest: XGBoost (0.0042 ms/sample)
- Slowest: Random Forest (0.0972 ms/sample)

### 3.5 Recommendation

A **hybrid IDS architecture** is recommended:
- **LightGBM** as primary classifier (best accuracy, lowest FPR)
- **SVM** as secondary anomaly detector (best generalization, highest DR for novel attacks)
